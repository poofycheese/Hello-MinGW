# Hello-MinGW

I don't know C++ very well, but I want to try to create a simple app using ChatGPTs help for fun. This app is a Windows Hello World app that popups native gui window. I used Eclipse 2023-03, MinGW GCC, MSYS2.

MSYS2 uses pacman to install the C/C++ compiler, libs, toolchain, etc., like Arch Linux which is nice.  This link helped set that up with the Eclipse CDT plugin.

Below is the ChatGTP conversation to get me started.

User:  can i see an example of a C program that pops up a windows dialog with "hello world" using MinGW

ChatGPT:  Certainly! Here's an example of a C program that uses MinGW to create a simple Windows dialog with the message "Hello, World!" displayed:

c
Copy code

`#include <windows.h>

// Window Procedure callback function
LRESULT CALLBACK WindowProc(HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
    switch (uMsg)
    {
        case WM_CLOSE:
            DestroyWindow(hwnd);
            break;
        case WM_DESTROY:
            PostQuitMessage(0);
            break;
        case WM_PAINT:
        {
            PAINTSTRUCT ps;
            HDC hdc = BeginPaint(hwnd, &ps);
            
            // Display the "Hello, World!" message
            TextOut(hdc, 10, 10, "Hello, World!", 13);
            
            EndPaint(hwnd, &ps);
            break;
        }
        default:
            return DefWindowProc(hwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam);
    }
    
    return 0;
}

int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow)
{
    // Register the window class
    const char* CLASS_NAME = "MyWindowClass";
    
    WNDCLASS wc = {0};
    wc.lpfnWndProc = WindowProc;
    wc.hInstance = hInstance;
    wc.lpszClassName = CLASS_NAME;
    
    RegisterClass(&wc);
    
    // Create the window
    HWND hwnd = CreateWindowEx(
        0,                      // Optional window styles
        CLASS_NAME,             // Window class name
        "Hello, World!",        // Window title
        WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,    // Window style
        
        // Size and position
        CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT,
        
        NULL,       // Parent window
        NULL,       // Menu
        hInstance,  // Instance handle
        NULL        // Additional application data
    );
    
    if (hwnd == NULL)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    
    // Display the window
    ShowWindow(hwnd, nCmdShow);
    
    // Message loop
    MSG msg;
    while (GetMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0))
    {
        TranslateMessage(&msg);
        DispatchMessage(&msg);
    }
    
    return msg.wParam;
}

To compile and run this program using MinGW, you can follow these steps:

Save the above code into a file, e.g., main.c.

Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved main.c.

Compile the program using the MinGW GCC compiler by running the following command:

css
Copy code
gcc main.c -o hello.exe
This will generate an executable file named hello.exe.

Run the program by executing the following command:

Copy code
hello.exe
A window should pop up with the message "Hello, World!" displayed. You can close the window to exit the program.

Make sure you have MinGW properly installed and set up on your system with the necessary environment variables configured for the compilation process.





User:  it gives an error when compiling.   "undefined reference to `__imp_TextOutA'"

ChatGPT:  The error you encountered, "undefined reference to __imp_TextOutA'", indicates that the linker is unable to find the definition for the TextOut` function.

This issue typically arises when the necessary library is not linked during the compilation process. In this case, you need to link against the gdi32 library, which contains the implementation of the TextOut function.

To resolve this error, you can modify the compilation command by explicitly specifying the gdi32 library for linking:

css
Copy code
gcc main.c -o hello.exe -lgdi32
The -lgdi32 option instructs the linker to link against the gdi32 library, which provides the required implementation for TextOut.

After making this change, try compiling the program again. It should link successfully and generate the hello.exe executable.
